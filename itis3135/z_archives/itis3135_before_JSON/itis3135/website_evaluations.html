                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a french website and from what I can tell, this website is a National Club for improvment of the Beauce Shepherds breed. 
                    The website has infomation about its memebrs, president, and event dates. 
                    Additionally, the website has vaccine and medical information.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                    <li>Repitition</li>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This website does a very bad job at following crap principles. 
                    First, the contrast is okay, but the red font on the main page is a little hard to read. 
                    And the link colors have been left using the default color, which is hard to see.
                    The images in the background also make the website look outdated with poor contrast. 
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Second, the cite has good text color and design Repitition. But that is not to say that it looks good.
                </p>    
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Third, the alignment is okay. Alot of things are centered, and the paragraphs are not centered, which is good.  
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Fourth, the the Proximity is horrible. The text appears to have no margins or padding from the left. 
                    The images are all crowded and overlapping. The whole website looks confusing and all over the place.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="crap">
                <a href="https://www.tesla.com" target="_blank">Tesla.com</a>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a website for the auto manufacturer Tesla.
                    The website has information about its available models, features, and pricing.
                    The website also has information about its Solar Panels, Solar roof, Powerwall, and all avaliable accessories.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                    <li>Repitition</li>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Tesla does a good job of following the crap principles.
                    The contrast is good and the page is kept simple and organized. 
                    This allows the importaint elements of the page to grab your attention.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The repition is very good.
                    There are sections for each model and product.
                    Each section is designed similarly or exacly like the main section.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The Alignment is very good. 
                    The main titles are centered, and all the images focal points are centered.
                    All the sections are also evely spaced out.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The Proximity is very good.
                    All text and images are given plenty of room to breathe.
                    Title items are all near the top of every section, making it easy to know where you are in the website
