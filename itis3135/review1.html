            <ul>
                <li>&#128200; Page Leads to the correct location with primary links. <br>True</li>
                <li>&#128201; File name and folder names are free of spaces and uppercase letters. <br> False: (HTMLInclude.min.js) <br>Otherwise, everything else is very good.</li>
                <li>&#128200;There is sufficient contrast and appropriate font sizing for readability. <br> True: The colors and font sizes are very easy to read.</li>
                <li>&#128200;Consistent site colors and fonts are applied via a standard `.css` file? <br>True</li>
                <li>&#128200;CRAP Principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) are followed. <br>True</li>
                <li>&#128200;Does the main content start with the page name in an `h2` (not the site/brand name)? <br>True</li>
                <li>&#128201;Does the footer include a menu linking to the users pages? <br> False: I am not able to access the linked pages in the footer.</li>
                <li>&#128200;Are HTML and CSS validation tools (e.g., Accumulus) included? <br> True: I see all validation links, and all are passing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Comments</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&#128200;Everything is very well done, and I am very impressed.</li>
                <li>&#128200;I really like the self switching E-Board page.</li>
                <li>&#128200;The events page layout is perfect and very easy to understand.</li>
                <li>&#128201;I would focus on making the culture and heritage page a little more intuitive and less crowded, or more organized. </li>
                <li>&#128201;I would out that same focus on the Membership page.</li>
                <li>&#128201;The membership form is hard to find (unless that is intentional).</li>
