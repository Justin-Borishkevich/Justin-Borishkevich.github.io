            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a someone who enjoys restoring and fixing things. 
                I take items that are broken, paper weights, and unusable, 
                then restoring them to desirable, working, and prestine condition.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Repair and restoration is something that has always been a passion of mine since I was young. 
                I would always watch my grandfather and dad repair cars, fix our driveway concrete, 
                fix holes in our drywall that would mysteriously appear, and much more.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My Workspace unsurprisingly depends on what I am fixing.
                Sometimes I am on cold concrete fixing a car and other times I am in the comfort of my room.
                But in general, I have one main workspace, and that is my room. 
                I have 3 desks that I use to work on projects.
                One desk with good lighting for soldering and small details.
                Another desk for general assembly and repair.
                And the last desk is for 3D Printing and dirty repairs.

            <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Repair was not something that magically appeared in my life. 
                It has always been a lifestyle and form of sustenance in my family.
                My dad would fix things around the house. My grandpa would fix cars. And my mom took tailoring classes in Ukraine, so she would skillfully fix and improve our clothing.
                Repair was a part of my life from a young age.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I never appreciated repair until I repaired my first phone in middle school. 
                My dad convinced me to buy a replacement screen and follow a youtube video.
                I fixed my phone and felt a sense of accomplishment and started looking for repair opportunities.
                From there, all my other hobbies somehow involved repair. 
                Leading me to realize my real hobby was repair.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Repair was nothing to brag about in my church. 
                Everyone in my church was involved with some sort of repair.
                The craze between all my buddies was fixing phones, computers, and restoring shoes.
                But me and a close friend decided to focus on a niche hobby. Repairing typewriters.
                My first typewriter was my first real repair project and one of my proudest accomplishments.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="why" class="section">
            <h2>Why repair</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of reasons for repair is endless. 
                But there is one point that I need to emphasize.
                Repair is a right. It is also a fundamental aspect of ownership.
                If you own something, you inherently have the ability to fix it.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But is Ownership itself a right? Yes it is.
                Consider an extreme example: your life. 
                If you do not have ownership of your life, anyone can take it without facing repercussions.
                This stark reality highlights the importance of ownership as a right for our existence.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise if you don't own anything, you effectively forfeit any sovereignty, self-governance, and autonomy. 
                Ownership is not merely a function of possession; 
                It is the foundation for our ability to make choices about our life and property.
                Because repair is an inherent extension of ownership, our right to repair is a right.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I emphasize the right to repair so much?
                Because it is a right that is often overlooked and brushed off in our consumer oriented society.
                This has led to the quiet erosion of our repair rights.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two examples are Apple and John Deere.
                Apple developed a serialization of their parts that prevents you from reusing an OEM part 
                without first using a proprietary apple repair software to serialize the new part to the current device.
                Why would a company need to do this? The short answer is profit. 
                Making your phone impossible or costly to repair incentivises you to buy a new phone instead.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The same situation is happening with our farmers. 
                John Deere has locked large amounts of farm equipment repair diagnostics behind dealer only access.
                One example would be repairing a $200 sensor that can not be used until you first have an authorized repair dealer come and unlock it for you.
                So if your tractor stops working because of a simple $200 sensor, your equipment becomes useless until a dealer comes to unlock it.
                Because farmers live in rural areas, it sometimes takes days for a dealer to show up.
                This becomes a major issue for farmers. Their window for harvesting crops lasts for only a few weeks.
                And when time is not a commodity, every day lost waiting for a repair dealer to show up, is millions of dollars lost in food for the American population.
                This is why many farmers are going back to older equipment that they can repair on their own. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of our right to repair might not affect most people directly, 
                but it will continue to be erroded until it becomes an indirect issue, 
                like food shortages, or your inability to have your car serviced for affordable rates because 
                its electronics are locked by the dealer.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to start helping preserve our right to repair is to spread awareness and begin to practice your right.
