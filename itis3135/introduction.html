                <li><b>Personal Background: </b>I am from a family that comes from Ukraine and has Polish roots. My grandparents and relatives all suffered through communism and its terrors, and immigrated to Rochester NY in 1995 not long after the Soviet Union collapsed. We are very patriotic to this amazing Country which is founded on Godly principles with an amazing Constitution. My family moved to NC in 2010 and has lived here ever since.</li>
                <li><b>Professional Background: </b>I've worked in various different places. But at this moment I spend the majority of my time helping my church's audio department and mixing sound for my worship team. I have experience mixing live audio using a variety of brands, like Behringer and Allen Heath. Currently we mix with an Allen Heath Avantis mixer.</li>
