            <p>Evaluation</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&#128200; Page Leads to the correct location with primary links. <br>True</li>
                <li>&#128201; File name and folder names are free of spaces and uppercase letters. <br> False: (HTMLInclude.min.js) <br>Otherwise, everything else is very good.</li>
                <li>&#128201; There is sufficient contrast and appropriate font sizing for readability. <br> False: The colors and font sizes are decent, but sometimes the font size is too small. <br>The link contrast is also very poor and the link changes color after clicked which is not reccomended by the professor. <br>The title is also difficult to see.</li>
                <li>&#128200; Consistent site colors and fonts are applied via a standard `.css` file? <br>True</li>
                <li>&#128200;&#128201; CRAP Principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) are followed. <br>True to some extent, but can be improved.</li>
                <li>&#128200; Does the main content start with the page name in an `h2` (not the site/brand name)? <br>True</li>
                <li>&#128201; Does the footer include a menu linking to the users pages? <br> False: I am not able to access the linked pages in the footer.</li>
                <li>&#128200; Are HTML and CSS validation tools (e.g., Accumulus) included? <br> True: I see all validation links, and all are passing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Comments</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&#x2757;&#x2757;&#x2757;&#x2757;&#x2757;Before you do anything else, please check if you have dark mode on. Your page looks much better when my browsers dark mode is on, making me speculate that you might be accidentally designing in dark mode.&#x2757;&#x2757;&#x2757;&#x2757;&#x2757;</li>
                <li>&#128200; Overall layout is clean and easy to understand.</li>
                <li>&#128200; I really like the google maps layout in the contact us page.</li>
                <li>&#128200; I also think that the end of year sale clock is pretty neat.</li>
                <li>&#128201; I would focus on making the Overall website less crowded, or more organized, and also making the images have a common max width or size. </li>
                <li>&#128201; I would also make the images a little smaller/out of the way since they end up taking up the entire page.</li>
                <li>&#128201; I would also use a min-height/height for main to make the footer stay at the bottom of the page and appear less cluttered in the home page.</li>
            </ul>

        <footer id="footer-container">
