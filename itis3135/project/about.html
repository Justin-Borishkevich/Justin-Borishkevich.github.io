                <p>About us</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a Worship team at Good News Church Charlotte. 
                    We started as a small teens team that would volunteer at teen services.
                    Eventually our team grew and we started volunteering at our youth services.
                    We gained more experience and eventually were asked to lead worship on sundays.
                    We are now a full time youth worship team and we are looking forward to more opportunities.
                    We are blessed to have the opportunity to serve in worship at Good News Church Charlotte.
                    We couldnt be more excited to be a part of this ministry and are looking forward to what God has planned for us.
                </p>
