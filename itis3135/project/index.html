            Project overview: 
Describe your application and its purpose. 
<p>This application will be a welcome and information page for a client who is a worship team leader and would like for a webpage with multiple attributes.</p>
<p>The intended users of the website are people who might be interested in joining the team. 
    Poeple who are just curious to see what the team is up to, their accomplishments, and their goals.
    Parents who want to show other people their sons and daughters singing and playing.</p>
<p>The content on the website will have a description of the team, their goals, and what they do.
